[00:10.68] (We're like diamonds in starlight)
[00:16.38] (Highlight, highlight, highlight)
[00:32.88] 
[00:20.30] Turn it up, to the top
[00:21.71] Let's get it started, go non-stop
[00:23.80] Bust through the door, we don't knock, just have a good time
[00:27.33] Like we never cared about what they say
[00:29.39] Tear up the place like it's our own
[00:31.17] Get wilder than a cyclone
[00:32.92] And leave it on a high note
[00:46.42] 
[00:35.23] And it's just like magic lighting up the sky
[00:38.85] Yeah, when we're together, we don't have to try
[00:42.50] If you wanna join then this is your invite
[00:46.11] Show 'em what you got, come on
[00:48.05] Don't be shy
[00:54.05] 
[00:49.71] We, we are breaking through borders
[00:53.34] Free, like the clouds are beneath us, oh
[00:57.02] We, we're like diamonds in starlight
[01:00.57] We shine in the dark night
[01:02.31] 'Cause we are the highlight

[01:15.50] We shine in the dark night
[01:17.28] 'Cause we are the highlight
[01:30.78] 
[01:19.19] Caught inside a bubble, full of doubts
[01:21.06] It's time to make it pop! (Na-na-na-na)
[01:23.14] Baby, just believe it, feel it
[01:24.59] Lose control, it's in your blood
[01:26.04] You know there ain't nobo-o-body
[01:28.11] Getting down like we do
[01:30.09] There ain't no pa-pa-party like a party with Miku
[01:54.59] 
[01:34.25] And it's just like magic lighting up the sky
[01:37.92] Yeah, when we're together, we don't have to try
